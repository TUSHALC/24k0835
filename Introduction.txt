Introduction of PSEUDOCODE
 Pseudocode is a high-level, structured representation of code that uses plain language to
 outline the steps and logic of a program, making it easier to design, understand, and 
 communicate algorithms and software solutions.
 
Introduction of ALGORITHM
 An algorithm is a well-defined, step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or achieving 
 a specific goal, typically involving a sequence of instructions, inputs, and outputs, that 
 can be implemented in various programming languages to produce a desired outcome.
 
Introduction of GITHUB
 GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration on software development 
 projects, allowing developers to share, manage, and contribute to code repositories, track 
 changes, and collaborate with others through features like commits, pull requests, and messaging.
